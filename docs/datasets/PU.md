# PU

## Dataset Description
- Synchronously measured motor currents and vibration signals with high resolution and sampling rate of 26 damaged bearing states and 6 undamaged (healthy) states for reference.
- Supportive measurement of speed, torque, radial load, and temperature.

## Dataset Structure

- 20 measurements of 4 seconds each for each setting, saved as a MatLab file with a name consisting of the code of the operating condition and the four-digit bearing code (e.g. N15_M07_F10_KA01_1.mat).

- Rotation: Hz

- Classes: Normal, Outer Ring Fault, Inner Ring Fault and Outer Ring + Inner Ring

- Domain: Time

- Sample rate:  samples per second
